## Summary

### CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models designed to process structured grid data such as images. They are composed of several types of layers including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### CNN Layers
- **Convolutional Layers:** Apply convolution operations to the input, capturing local patterns.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity into the model, common functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample the input, reducing the spatial dimensions and computational load.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, used for classification tasks.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models on new but related tasks. This approach can significantly reduce training time and improve model performance.

### Image Classification
Image classification is the task of categorizing images into predefined classes. CNNs are particularly effective for this task due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies.

### Object Detection
Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image. It is a more complex task than image classification, requiring both localization and classification.

## Code Examples

### CNN Example
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define CNN model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

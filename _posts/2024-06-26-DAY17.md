## Summary

### Getting Started with OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is widely used for real-time computer vision applications. This session covers fundamental operations to manipulate and process images using OpenCV's rich set of functions and algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical initial step in the data science workflow. It involves using Python libraries to inspect, summarize, and visualize data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key steps in performing EDA with Python:

Importing Libraries:
pandas (pd): For data manipulation and analysis. NumPy (np): For numerical computations. Matplotlib.pyplot (plt): For basic plotting functionalities. Seaborn (sns): A built-on top of Matplotlib, providing high-level visualization.

Loading the Data:
Use pd.read_csv() for CSV files, similar functions exist for other data formats (e.g., .xlsx, .json).

Initial Inspection:
Get an overview of the data using df.head(), .tail(), and .info(). Check data types with df.dtypes.

Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values using methods like df.isnull().sum(). Find and address duplicates with df.duplicated().sum().

Univariate Analysis:
Analyze single variables at a time. Use descriptive statistics with df.describe() for numerical data. Create histograms, box plots, and density plots to visualize distributions.

Bivariate Analysis:
Explore relationships between two variables. Create scatter plots to identify trends and potential correlations.

Visualization:
Effective visualizations are crucial for understanding data. Use various plots like bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent categorical data.
